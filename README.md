# Combo Translator

 Reading combo notations can be very confusing, especially for someone new to fighting games.  This app was made to help make combo notations easier to read.  Just paste or manually type in a combo.  You can also click an image to see what that specific notation means.

 ## Formatting
 ---
  **NOTE: USING NUMPAD OR ABBREVIATED NOTATIONS IS HIGHLY RECOMENDED**
 ### General
 
 ### Comments
 Use parentheses to add comments to your combo
 > `(comment using parentheses)`
 
### Inputs
 Generally, commas are used to separate inputs
 > `mp,mp, qcf+p`
 
 Combine inputs using "+".
 > `1+2`-->`Outputs "1+2"`
 `1 2`-->`Outputs "1" "2"`
 
 Try to use numpad notation and abreviated motions whenever possible as  they are the most reliable
 > `236+p` instead of `hadoken`
 `360` instead of `spinning pile driver`
 `qcfqcf+p` instead of `super`
